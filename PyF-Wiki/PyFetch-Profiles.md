# PyFetch Profiles
PyFetch Profiles are configs (seperate from pyfetch.conf) that are created in PyFetch 1.2 PyPersonalization.
If you want to test a config or you just want a fresh workspace without modifying your current one,
PyFetch Profiles will be the solution (even if you're only going to mess around with the feature).
